The conditions for deadlock detection are discussed and simplified for the special case of one-node or two-node queuing network with population restrictions. \n",

    "This research studies how to detect the deadlock phenomenon in an open restricted queuing network. In this study, the author(s) solve(s) the deadlock problem to a limited case by making an important assumption.

As a result, this study obtains a bound on the expected time to deadlock.\n",

    "My view is that the paper concerns a problem of interest and that it makes some good contributions to furthering our understanding of blocking/deadlock. Nonetheless, (i) I believe that the paper could be much improved presentationally, and (ii) I am yet to be convinced that the weight of contribution is sufficient for publication in EJOR. On the latter point, please either convince me of the importance of the material in Sections 3 and 4 (along with the novelty of Section 2) or develop the material to the point where it does.\n",

    "GENERAL: The paper discusses the concept of blocking (ie, further movement is not possible) and deadlock in open (arrivals and departures from outside the network are possible), restricted (at least one server has limited waiting space) queueing networks. A theoretical result is given which uses a digraph construction to determine when deadlock has been reached in such a network. Ideas are illustrated by some small scale examples. Finally, a result is given which describes how the expected time to deadlock for a particular small network may be bounded above by the equivalent time for constituent sub-networks."

    "CONCLUSION I do not believe that the case for either the importance of blocking/deadlock as phenomena in these queueing networks or for the contribution to their study contained in the paper has yet been made. I anticipate that the case for the novelty of the work in Section 2 can in fact be easily made. However, the material in Sections 3 and 4 does not yet look to me to be of sufficient weight, novelty or significance to merit publication in EJOR as it currently stands. That said, I am open to the authors convincing me otherwise or to producing further material (concerning more general networks, for example) which would give the paper the greater scope it appears to need."
